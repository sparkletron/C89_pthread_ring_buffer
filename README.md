## Release Versions
### Current
  Tag: release_v1.5.4

  - 1.5.4 - Cast pointer to char so the library isn't using GCC void * math.

### Past
  - 1.5.3 - Element size was being put into buffer size twice... buffers too big.
  - 1.5.2 - Changed size to long for unsigned for greater memory utilization.
  - 1.5.1 - Added __cplusplus ifdef check to add extern C for cpp application builds.
  - 1.5.0 - Major fix for element bug. For some reason I didn't divide the return.
            1.4.0 added a bug where len will be wrong if element size is not 1 for
            its fix.
  - 1.4.0 - Fix for read started before write and write ends blocking in one pass.
  - 1.3.0 - Added private blocking check method to the blocking read/write.
  - 1.2.0 - Code cleanup, added const.
  - 1.1.0 - Added timed wait_until to blocking read/write.

## BUGS
  - There is a segfault bug when the size is too large (unsigned long should have no issue v1.5.2), need to convert back to unsigned, (v1.5.1) and test test test till its found.

## Requirements
  - GCC
  - pthread library

## Building with CMAKE
  1. mkdir build
  2. cd build
  3. cmake ../

    - use -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF option for static library.
    - use -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON option for shared library.
    - use -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON option for examples to be built as well.

  4. make

## Building with Makefile (OLD)
  - make libringbuffer.so for dynamic
  - make libringbuffer.a  for static
  - make exe for test applications
  - make for all

## Documentation
  - See doxygen generated document

## Example Code
  - See eg/src/ directory for examples.

### Currect Examples
  - file_cp = file copy example program
